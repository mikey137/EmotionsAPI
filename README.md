EmotionsWheelAPI

https://mikey137.github.io/EmotionsAPI/

This app is intended to be an interactive emotions wheel. Ideally, it will be used by clinicians, occupational therapists, teachers, and parents to help facilitate conversations about different emotional concepts with their clients, students, kids, etc. The app provides definitions, images, and videos of a variety of different emotions. Not all of the images and videos perfectly represent each emotion as the intention isn't to provide exact answers but rather a starting place for a conversation.
