EmotionsWheelAPI

https://mikey137.github.io/EmotionsAPI/

This app is intended to be an interactive emotions wheel. Ideally it will be used by clinicians, occupational therapists, teachers, and parents, to help facilitate conversations about different emotional concepts with their clients, students, kids, ect. The app provides definitions, images, and videos of a variety of different emotions. Not all of the images and videos perfectly represent each emotion, which is fine, the intention isn't to provide exact answers, but to provide a starting place for a conversation.
